Programs I have created during the 'Data Encoding and Compression' Course at Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska, 10.2021 - 06.2022

Includes:
Calculating Entropy of a file; (l1)
Lossless Compression using Arithmetic coding of text and binary files; (l2)
LZW file compression implementation with numbers encoded using universal codes: Elias Gamma, Delta and Omega as well as Fibonacci coding; (l3)
TGA image encoding using predictive coding with multiple predictors; (l4)
TGA image encoding using Vector quantization with LBG algortihm to find the available colors; (l5)
TGA image encoding using subband coding with scalar adaptive vecctorization; (L6)
Huffman encoding with a cyclic (7,4)code generated by g(x) = 1 + x + x^3; (L7)
