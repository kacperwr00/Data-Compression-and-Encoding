Programs I have created during the 'Data Encoding and Compression' Course at Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska, 10.2021 - 06.2022  
Includes:
<ul>
<li>Calculating Entropy of a file; (l1)</li>
<li>Lossless Compression using Arithmetic coding of text and binary files; (l2)</li>
<li>LZW file compression implementation with numbers encoded using universal codes: Elias Gamma, Delta and Omega as well as Fibonacci <li>coding; (l3)</li>
<li>TGA image encoding using predictive coding with multiple predictors; (l4)</li>
<li>TGA image encoding using Vector quantization with LBG algortihm to find the available colors; (l5)</li>
<li>TGA image encoding using subband coding with scalar adaptive vecctorization; (L6)</li>
<li>Hamming encoding with a cyclic (7,4)code generated by g(x) = 1 + x + x^3; (L7)</li>
</ul>
